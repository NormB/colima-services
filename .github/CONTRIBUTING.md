## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. Please read [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/colima-services.git
   cd colima-services
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with appropriate values
   ./manage-colima.sh start
   ```

### Setting Up SSH and GPG Keys for Forgejo

To enable authenticated Git operations and commit signing with the local Forgejo instance:

#### Add SSH Key (for git push/pull authentication)

1. **Display your public key:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   # Or: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

2. **Add to Forgejo:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Sign in to your account
   - Go to Settings → SSH / GPG Keys
   - Click "Add Key" under SSH Keys
   - Paste your public key
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Mac Development Key")
   - Click "Add Key"

#### Add GPG Key (for signed commits)

1. **List your GPG keys:**
   ```bash
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
   ```

2. **Export your public key:**
   ```bash
   # Replace KEY_ID with your key ID from the previous command
   gpg --armor --export KEY_ID
   ```

3. **Add to Forgejo:**
   - Navigate to Settings → SSH / GPG Keys
   - Click "Add Key" under GPG Keys
   - Paste the entire GPG public key block (including BEGIN/END lines)
   - Click "Add Key"

#### Configure Git for Signed Commits

```bash
# Set your GPG key for signing commits
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID

# Enable automatic commit signing
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

#### Configure SSH for Forgejo

Add to your `~/.ssh/config`:
```
Host forgejo
  HostName localhost
  Port 2222
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Then you can clone and push using:
```bash
git clone forgejo:username/repo.git
```

## Coding Standards

### Shell Scripts

- Use `bash` (not `sh`)
- Include shebang: `#!/bin/bash`
- Use 4-space indentation
- Quote variables: `"$VARIABLE"`
- Use `[[` instead of `[` for conditionals
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use functions for reusable code
- Check exit codes: `|| { error "Failed"; exit 1; }`

### Docker Compose

- Use version 3.8+ syntax
- Include health checks for all services
- Use explicit image tags (not `latest`)
- Document environment variables
- Use secrets for sensitive data
- Add resource limits when appropriate
- Include descriptive labels

### Configuration Files

- Use clear, descriptive names
- Include comments explaining purpose
- Document all options
- Provide sensible defaults
- Use environment variables for flexibility

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add screenshots for UI elements
- Keep line length under 100 characters
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Update table of contents when adding sections

## Testing

### Required Tests

Before submitting a PR, verify:

1. **Clean installation works**:
   ```bash
   ./manage-colima.sh clean
   ./manage-colima.sh start
   ```

2. **All services start healthy**:
   ```bash
   ./manage-colima.sh health
   ```

3. **Vault operations work**:
   ```bash
   ./manage-colima.sh vault-init
   ./manage-colima.sh vault-bootstrap
   ```

4. **Service-specific tests**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-tests.sh
   ```

5. **No regressions**:
   - Test existing functionality still works
   - Check logs for errors: `./manage-colima.sh logs`

### Test Coverage

- Add tests for new features
- Update tests for modified functionality
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test error handling and edge cases
