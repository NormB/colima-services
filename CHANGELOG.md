## Version History Guidelines

When releasing a new version, move changes from [Unreleased] to a new version section:

### Version Format
```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Change Categories
- **Added** - New features
- **Changed** - Changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated** - Soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed** - Removed features
- **Fixed** - Bug fixes
- **Security** - Security improvements or vulnerability fixes

### Example Entry
```markdown
## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-15

```

### Semantic Versioning

- **Major version (X.0.0)** - Incompatible API changes or breaking changes
  - Example: Removing a service, changing default ports, breaking configuration changes

- **Minor version (0.X.0)** - Backwards-compatible new features
  - Example: Adding a new service, adding new management script commands

- **Patch version (0.0.X)** - Backwards-compatible bug fixes
  - Example: Fixing a bug, updating documentation, security patches

### When to Update

1. **Before creating a PR**: Add your changes to [Unreleased]
2. **When merging a PR**: Ensure CHANGELOG is updated
3. **When creating a release**: Move [Unreleased] changes to a new version section
4. **For security fixes**: Always document in Security section

### Best Practices

- Write changes from a user's perspective, not developer's
- Be concise but descriptive
- Include references to issues/PRs when relevant: `Fixes #123`
- Group similar changes together
- Order changes by impact (most significant first)
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

### Migration Notes

For breaking changes, consider adding a migration guide:

```markdown
### Migration from 0.x to 1.0

**Breaking Changes:**
- PostgreSQL port changed from 5432 to 5433
- Redis cluster configuration format updated

**Migration Steps:**
1. Backup your data: `./manage-colima.sh backup`
2. Update your .env file with new configuration
3. Restart services: `./manage-colima.sh restart`
4. Verify: `./manage-colima.sh health`
```
